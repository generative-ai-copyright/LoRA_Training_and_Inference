# LoRA_Training_and_Inference

Try with the provided `TEST.ipynb` and the provided training set `mini_harvard` and `mini_harvard_dreambooth` which are only differed by a `.csv` file for captioning first.
Alter the parameters and change the dataset and experiment with this further as needed.

The parameter `mixed_precision` can be changed to `fp16` for better compatibility for Nvidia 20-series graphics cards or older.
